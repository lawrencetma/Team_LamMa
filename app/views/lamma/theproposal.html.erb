  <h2 class="cursive">The Story</h2>
  <p>
    I originally wanted to have the proposal on a beach but at the last minute we had to change plans because Helen's mom didn't want us take all our dogs into her SUV! Haha.  Helen's sister Janet helped me plan it out and I had made a small frame to attach to Penny's harness and I kept it in my huge jacket on a warm Los Angeles day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plan was to tell Helen to run off so I could attach the harness and Penny would run after her.  Problem was, Helen wanted me to run off instead!  Good thing Janet was thinking on her feet and she had Helen walk over to the side so while they were walking I nervously attached the harness and watched Penny run as fast as she could to Helen.

    Thankfully, she said yes!
